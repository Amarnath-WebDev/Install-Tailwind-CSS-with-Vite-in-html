# Tailwind CSS Installation Guide with Vite in Html file 

## Introduction
This guide provides a detailed, step-by-step process for setting up Tailwind CSS in your project using Vite as the build tool. Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid UI development.

## Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript and Node.js
- Node.js installed on your machine

## Step-by-Step Installation

### Step 1: Install Node.js
If you haven't already, download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/). Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

### Step 2: Create a New Project
1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to create your project.
3. Create a new project folder and navigate into it:
   ```bash
   mkdir my-tailwind-project
   cd my-tailwind-project
   ```

### Step 3: Initialize a New Node.js Project
Run the following command to initialize a new Node.js project:
```bash
npm init -y
```

### Step 4: Install Tailwind CSS and Dependencies
Run the following command to install Tailwind CSS, PostCSS, Autoprefixer, and Vite:
```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer vite
```

### Step 5: Initialize Tailwind CSS
Run the following command to create the Tailwind CSS configuration files:
```bash
npx tailwindcss init -p
```
This will generate two files: `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js`.

### Step 6: Install Tailwind CSS IntelliSense (Optional)
If you are using Visual Studio Code, you can enhance your development experience by installing the Tailwind CSS IntelliSense extension. Search for it in the Extensions Marketplace or [install it directly from here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=BradCornford.TailwindCSSIntelliSense).

### Step 7: Configure Tailwind CSS
Open the `tailwind.config.js` file and update the `content` array to include all your template files. For instance:
```javascript
module.exports = {
  content: ['./src/**/*.{html,js}'], // Adjust the path according to your project structure.
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

### Step 8: Add Scripts to `package.json`
Open `package.json` and add the following scripts to the `"scripts"` section:
```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "vite",
  "build": "vite build",
  "serve": "vite preview"
}
```

### Step 9: Create `main.css`
1. Create a new file named `main.css` in the `src` directory.
2. Inside `main.css`, insert the following lines:
   ```css
   @tailwind base;
   @tailwind components;
   @tailwind utilities;
   ```

### Step 10: Link `main.css` in Your HTML
Open your `index.html` file (or create one in the `src` directory) and link the `main.css` file inside the `<head>` section:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Your Project Title</title>
    <link href="/src/main.css" rel="stylesheet">
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Your HTML content goes here -->
</body>
</html>
```

### Step 11: Start the Development Server
Run the following command to start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port indicated in the terminal) to see your project in action.
